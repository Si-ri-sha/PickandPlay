## WELCOME TO GAME HUB

A collection of three classic games built with JavaScript, CSS and HTML. Each game in this hub represents a learning milestone, from handling user input and logic building to managing UI updates and local storage.

### Games Included:

1. Guess the Number â€“ A simple yet addictive game where the player has to guess a randomly generated number. Helped me solidify my understanding of event handling, conditional logic.

2. Memory Game â€“ A card-matching game with a built-in timer and leaderboard using local storage. This game improved my skills in DOM manipulation and data persistence.

3. Tic-Tac-Toe â€“ The classic strategy game with dynamic board updates. This project deepened my grasp of game logic, winning condition checks, and interactive UI updates.

#### Learning Progress & Key Takeaways:

- JavaScript Fundamentals â€“ Strengthened my understanding of functions, loops, and event-driven programming.
- DOM Manipulation â€“ Built dynamic interfaces that respond to user actions smoothly.
- Local Storage â€“ Implemented a leaderboard system to track player scores.
- CSS Styling & Layouts â€“ Improved UI with better alignment, responsiveness, and animations.
- Problem-Solving & Debugging â€“ Faced (and fixed!) various logical and UI-related bugs along the way.

This project is just the beginningâ€”Iâ€™ll be expanding on it with more features, refinements, and new challenges as i get into core concepts.
